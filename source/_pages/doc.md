- [graviton](https://github.com/libgraviton) REST server (hosted under libgraviton for historical reasons)
- [graviphoton](https://github.com/graviphoton) JavaScript based user interface
- [gravity-plattform](https://github.com/gravity-platform) platform for developing and running graviton and graviphoton

Next, you might head over to the [Installation Guide](/doc/install.html) to get started. The
[Developer Guide](/doc/hacking.html) is also an important resource.

Please note that gravity-plattform is still very unstable.
