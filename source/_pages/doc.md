- [graviton](https://github.com/libgraviton) REST server (hosted under libgraviton for historical reasons)
- [graviphoton](https://github.com/graviphoton) JavaScript based user interface
- [gravity-plattform](https://github.com/gravity-platform) platform for developing and running graviton and graviphoton

Next, you might head over to the [Installation Guide](/ops/installation_guide) to get started. The
[Developer Guide](/guides/developer_guide) is also an important resource.

Please note that gravity-plattform is still very unstable.
