Historically, naming things in IT wasn't considered that important. That was wrong. Naming *is* important.
If you still didn't realize that, consider this: **You are dead wrong and probably stupid.**

In this context of services and APIs, naming becomes even more relevant. Especially logical, structured and
meaningful naming. This guide outlines some basic principals we want to adhere in regard to the naming our services.

**Important:** This guide covers naming of *services* built with/on the gravity platform, it is not relating to the code of 
the platform itself.
